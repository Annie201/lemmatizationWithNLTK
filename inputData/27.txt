XIAOTITLE Apple - The latest on Apple - CNET News.
Editor s note: The iPhone is 5 years old.
Last year, I reflected on my very first iPhone, and what owning one was like before the smartphone landscape had utterly changed...before the App Store...before iPads.
What I wrote last year is still true now, maybe even more so, although one important event has transpired since: Steve Jobs died October 5, 2011, less than four months later.
What follows is what I wrote, along with photos of that iPhone that I still have kicking around, compared with the iPhone 4S.
Looking at them side by side, it s amazing how little has changed in terms of form.
It was only 2007 when the iPhone debuted.
It seems like longer.
My first HDTV, my Wii, and my PlayStation 3 all existed before the first iPhone.
Yet, in 2007, BlackBerrys were all the rage.
The Motorola Q was an eye-catching phone.
Android didn t exist.
Also, my grandparents were still alive.
I wasn t married.
I didn t have a kid.
I was freelance-writing a novel.
My life was different then.
The iPhone lines were crazy, but if you picked the right time you could sneak into an Apple Store and buy one.
That s because the first iPhone started at $499.
No one knew yet whether the device was a smash hit.
Apple didn t have a reservation system in place yet, or claim tickets.
In the summer of 2007, the iPhone was a novelty.
