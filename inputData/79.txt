XIAOTITLE uglyblackjohn: Apple Bottom Jeans.
If I hear another big girl telling me that she thinks she looks good in her  Skinny Jeans ,  I m never going out again.
The thing that kills me is that Nelly named his brand  Apple Bottom .
Having an apple bottom is not a good thing...
 Just ask Sherri Shepherd.
Her waist is larger than her butt.
Her butt looks like an apple.
 See what I mean?
Not a good shape for a woman.
 To the other extreme is Paris Hilton s  Pancake Bottom .
 Who likes pancakes with no butt(er)?
 But most women hate to hear that their butt looks like a fresh juicy pear.
But a small waist and then....
I thought it was a good thing.
