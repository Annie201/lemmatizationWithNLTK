XIAOTITLE Apple almost 25 percent of computer market, if iPads are counted (or not... see update) | The Verge.
Despite the profusion of Android tablets we saw at CES, Chris Whitmore from Deutsche Bank doesn t think Apple has anything to worry about in terms of iPad competition.
To emphasize the importance of the iPad to computing, Whitmore created the chart above, which takes market share reports for the computer market, then adds iPads in the last line.
Given that Android devices made up about 30 percent of the tablet market in Q3 of 2011, adding tablets in general would make the chart look somewhat different, but there s no denying that it s quite dramatic.
Update: Things may not be as they seem!
Over at Apple Outsider , they ve run the numbers and gotten closer to 15 percent Apple market share with iPads added in; they speculate that Whitmore may have re-added all Apple computers, not just iPads.
Here s some updated data , including sources and methods â€” their version of the chart is below.
Checking the calculations, we re seeing roughly the same thing.
