In 2000, when Universal Records released Nelly’s platinum debut album, Country Grammar, his clothing line for men, Vokal, had already been in production for two years.
In 2002 Cornelius “Nelly” Haynes Jr., by then a successful rapper and diversified entrepreneur, founded Apple Bottoms Jeans.
A sister company to Vokal, Apple Bottoms bases its designs off of Nelly’s idea that ?The clothes should fit a woman, not the woman fit the clothes.?
Jeans in the Apple Bottoms collection are notorious for accentuating the female feature they’re named after, the derriere, and signature details like apple-shaped back pockets.
Among his many entrepreneurial endeavors (Nelly co-owns the Charlotte Bobcats and his own entertainment and recording label Derrty Entertainment), Apple Bottoms has helped proliferate Nelly’s hip hop empire.
He uses his success as a business man to fund a non-profit organization called 4Sho4Kids and the Jes Us 4 Jackie Campaign, established to help his little sister’s fight against lukemia and increase membership to the Bone Marrow Donor Registry.
The Apple Bottoms brand name, synonymous with the voluptuous behinds of target consumers, is meant to draw attention to the fact that not every woman has a supermodel figure.
The jeans are flattering to women with curvy figures and are offered in a myriad of washes and rises.
