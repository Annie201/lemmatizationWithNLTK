XIAOTITLE Apple - Fruit.
Apples have a rounded shape with a depression at the top where the stem is attached.
Some apples are almost perfectly round, while others are more rounded at the top and narrower at the bottom.  In addition, some have knobby lobes at the calyx end (bottom) of the fruit.  Apple fruits are firm and the skin is shiny and smooth.
The color of the skin can be red, green, yellow, or a combination of those colors.
The flesh is white or ivory.
