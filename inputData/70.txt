XIAOTITLE fatshionista: Jeans for apple-shaped ladies.
Jeans for apple-shaped ladies So I just moved to Seattle a few weeks ago and I am slightly desperate to find some jeans that fit and don t sag all over the butt, hips, and legs, since it s colder here than my previous city.
I had given up on wearing jeans altogether and just wore dresses, but becoming a stay-at-home mom and moving to a chillier city has definitely motivated me to find some jeans that work.
I carry the majority of my weight in my belly - and pregnancy didn t help!
I have no idea what size of jeans I even wear (22/24 in dresses, but pants have always needed to be much bigger than tops/dresses).
Am I doomed to just needing a good tailor for every pair of jeans I buy?
Anyone with my body type have some suggestions?
