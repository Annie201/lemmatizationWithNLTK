XIAOTITLE Jeans That Fit: Apple Shape (Fashion For Your Shape).
The right pair of jeans can bring out the best in any woman s figure.
But finding jeans that fit, let alone flatter, can be tough.
Here s how to give an apple shape some extra polish.
Step 1: Cut The apple-shaped body type carries weight in the chest and stomach, and often has slim arms and legs.
To balance out this shape, choose a jean with a low waist to lengthen the torso.
A straight leg or wide, fluid pant is the look for your shape.
Step 2: Color You re lucky in that you can try lighter or colored jeans with a darker shirt to try to balance your top and bottom halves.
Step 3: Fit If you re getting some  muffin top  with a low rise jean, try a higher waisted jean, but pair it with a long top to lengthen your torso back down.
Some brands make jeans with slim legs that are wider in the waist: Try J Brand or Page.
Step 4: Style Look for jeans with long pockets, or pockets placed lower than usual.
Also look for some darting in the back for shape.
