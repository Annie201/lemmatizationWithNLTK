XIAOTITLE Apple Bottom Jeans Purse Handbag upcycle silky fur by Pyroteeze.
These cute apple bottom Jeans were/are size 5/6, making it about 12in across, 9in tall, and the strap hangs about 28in from your shoulder but can be tied to any legnth!
the pants were worn a bit, but it very good condition when i picked them out, and the army green silky curly fur inside was bought new to match the green silk on the inside of the jeans.
the pockets were left unstitched so you can easily drop your keys and coupons in there while shopping, but there is also the main zipper top PLUS something i like to call the cROTch-pocket.
its about 4x5 inside the cROTch zipper!
if you just want to ask questions, request something custom, or ask about multiples, just message me! i make way too many things to list, just ask, i prolly do!
pipes, earrings, plugs, bottles, snuffers, clothes, purses, paintings is just the beginning...
