XIAOTITLE Rare Apple 1 computer sold for £240k - Telegraph.
The computer, consisting only of a naked motherboard, with primitive microchips and circuitry exposed, is thought to be one of only around half a dozen working examples of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak s first hardware.
Some 200 Apple 1s were built in 1976 and sold at retail for $666.66 without a case, keboard, monitor or power supply.
The computer had 4 kilobytes of memory as standard and a processor running at 1 MHz.
By comparison, the latest iPhone has 512 megabytes of memory, and a dual-core processor running at 800 MHz.
The Apple 1 sold for $374,500 (£240,929) at an auction in New York.
The price was considerably more than Sotheby s estimate of $180,000 and sets a new record for a sale of one of the machines.
 When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs presented the Apple 1 Computer to the Homebrew Computer Club in 1976, it was dismissed by everyone but Paul Terrell, the owner of a chain of stores called Byte Shop,  said Sotheby s in its catalogue for the auction, which is scheduled to take place in New York today.
The Apple 1 was different to most personal computers at the time.
Steve Wozniak told peers in the Homebrew Computer Club that his circuitry and software enabled  a human-typable keyboard instead of a stupid, cryptic front panel with a bunch of lights and switches .
It s estimated that of the original 200, only around 50 remain, and only six of those are known to be in working order.
Two years ago Christies sold a working Apple 1 for $210,700, although it came with a signed letter from Steve Jobs.
Earlier this year a prototype of the first Apple Mac went on sale on eBay, with a starting price of $99,995 but no bids were made.
