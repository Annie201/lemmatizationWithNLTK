XIAOTITLE Copella Fruit Juices - Suffolk Fresh Pressed Apple Juice | Natural Fresh Fruit Juices - Boxford Farm Suffolk.
Once the apples have been picked, they are placed gently in crates by variety and date and held in chilled storage until they are pressed.
In general, later harvest apples store better than early harvest apples, so apples picked October - early November will store well and sustain the supply of Copella through the following seasons.
We select apples by variety to create the blend of apple varieties in our press that makes Copella taste so great.
