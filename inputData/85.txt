Launched in 2010 by Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne — the designers behind cult-favorite label Public School — Black Apple blends streetwear, rock ‘n’ roll, and military influences into a full line of men’s clothing and accessories that can stand up to daily life in the brand’s home base of NYC.
That means gear that’s as tough as it is wearable, from off-kilter outerwear to perfectly imperfect shirts and cleverly skewed knits.
Top things off with accessible prices and an unflagging commitment to innovating the collection each season, and you’ve got an upstart line that’s poised for very big things.
