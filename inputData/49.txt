XIAOTITLE Bare Fruit Snacks.
It used to be hard to eat your recommended fruit servings.
But Bare Fruit provides two servings of fruit in every bag.
Since Bare Fruit is simply fruit and nothing else, you get the full benefit of all the fiber, vitamins, and energy fruit provides.
Bare Fruit is just that, fruit undressed.
Our ingredients list is simple: Organic Apples (sometimes we add organic cinnamon).
Nothing else is added.
Nothing stands between you and our delicious chips.
Our bake-dried solution creates a crispy chip that tastes just right.
Organic can mean many things.
At Bare Fruit we take Organic to another level.
All our apples come from Washington State and are bake-dried within thirty miles of the orchard.
No pesticides, sustainable farming, local production.
Organic not only is better for you, it tastes better too.
