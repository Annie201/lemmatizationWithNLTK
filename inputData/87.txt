XIAOTITLE Apple Tree Jeans.
Is this your project?
Can you share instructions or a pattern with the Craftsy community?
What was your inspiration?
My daughter s jeans were looking a little beat-up, so I thought I d give them new life by adding some applique.
I did this project just before Arbor day, so, I chose a tree for the applique.
I made it an apple tree because my daughter loves apples.
What are you most proud of?
That she loves them so much.
That, and I extended the life of the jeans.
She can be pretty tough on clothes sometimes.
What advice would you give someone starting this project?
This is a fun, easy way to fix up some old jeans.
I used backstitch for the outlines and French knots for the apples.
I purposely left the edges raw, so they will fray a little.
You can finish the edges if the frayed edge isn t a look you like.
