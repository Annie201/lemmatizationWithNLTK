XIAOTITLE Washington State Fruit - Apple.
Washington designated the apple as the official state fruit in 1989.
Washington produces about 42 percent of the apples grown in the United States (and 60% of those grown for fresh consumption).
The majority of apple production occurs east of the Cascade Mountains in the central areas of the state.
During 1997-2001 Washingtons  apple production averaged about 123 millon bushels per year.
Many varieties of apple are grown in Washington state inclucing Red Delicious,Golden Delicious, Fuji, Gala, Granny Smith, Braeburn, Jonagold, Pink Lady, and Cameo.
About 100 packing houses store, sort, box and ship Washington Apples nearly all 12 months of the year.
Washington growers are able to produce apples using organic methods relatively successfully because of low disease pressure from apple scab and the absence of some key pests (such as Plum Curculio and Apple Maggot).
