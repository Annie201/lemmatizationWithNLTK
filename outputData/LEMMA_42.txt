XIAOTITLE Copella Fruit Juices - Suffolk Fresh Pressed Apple Juice | Natural Fresh Fruit Juices - Boxford Farm Suffolk.
Once the apple have been picked, they are placed gently in crate by variety and date and held in chilled storage until they are pressed.
In general, later harvest apple store better than early harvest apples, so apple picked October - early November will store well and sustain the supply of Copella through the following seasons.
We select apple by variety to create the blend of apple variety in our press that make Copella taste so great.
