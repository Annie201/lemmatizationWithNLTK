XIAOTITLE The Best Computer Apple Has Ever Made Is Unveiled at WWDC.
Although Apple s annual developer conference focus on software , in many way the biggest announcement were for the new line of MacBook laptops.
Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a well a a thinner version of the MacBook Pro and an update to the MacBook Air lines. Most of this had been well predicted, but the machine were still notable both for the design detail and the pricing. All these new machine are shipping now, Apple says.
The big news about the new MacBook Pro with Retina display is, of course, it 15.4-inch, 2880-by-1800 display, with four time the density of the previous generation.
The best computer Apple ha ever made, is how Phil Schiller, Apple s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, described it, and indeed, I don t know any other notebook with nearly the resolution. Apple say this is the world s highest resolution notebook display, with a resolution of 220 pixel per inch.
The basic screen technology ha improved a well, so it is still glossy but with le glare.  The MacBook Pro with Retina display is 0.71 inch thin, about the same size a the MacBook Air, and weighs 4.46 pounds. It ha quad-core processor from Intel s third-generation Core family, starting with the 2.3 GHz Core i7 and going up to a 2.7 GHz model, with turbo speed of up to 3.2 GHz.
It includes Nvidia GT 650M graphic (Kepler), with up to 16GB of 1600 GHz memory, up to 768 GB of Flash storage. Apple claim up to seven hour of battery life, or 30 day of standby.  Other feature include an SD card slot, HDMI (finally), two USB 3.0 ports, a thinner Mag Safe power slot, and two Thunderbolt port (and optional cable for connecting Firewire 800 and Gigabit Ethernet to Thunderbolt). It also will have a glass trackpad, backlit keyboard, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Facetime HD camera, dual microphones, and improved stereo speakers. The base price is $2,199, including a 2.3 GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 1GB of graphic memory, and 256GB of Flash storage.  To go along with the new machine is an update version of OS X Lion, with support for the higher-resolution display. Built-in apps such a Mail and iPhoto have been updated, a have other Apple program such a Aperture and Final Cut Pro X. It look particularly appropriate for these kind of applications, with one demo showing Final Cut with a full HD video running in one corner of the screen.
Apps have to be updated to take advantage of the new display, otherwise they will just be pixel-doubled. Schiller said many third-party developer are updating their application to take advantage of this, and he specifically mentioned Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk, and Diablo III.

The other change in the MacBook line are smaller, but still welcome.   The MacBook Air will now have the dual-core third generation Core (Ivy Bridge) processors, running at up to 2.0 GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.2 GHz and the new HD 4000 integrated graphics. It will be available with up to 8GB 1600 GHz DDR memory, and with up to 512GB of Flash storage (which Schiller said offered 500 MBps read speed, up to twice a fast a previously). It will add USB 3.0 and an updated FaceTime HD camera.
The 11.6-inch version, with a 1366–by-768 display and a 1.7 GHz dual-core core i5 processor, is 0.68-inchs thin, weighs  2.38 pounds, and cost $999. The 13.3-inch version, with a 1440-by-900 display and a 1.8 GHz dual-core core i5 processor, ha the same height, weighs 2.96 pounds, and cost $1,199. Both now have entry point $100 le than the previous models.   The regular MacBook Pro ha gotten a big refresh and it, too, is now much slimmer. The big difference here is that this line will take both dual-core and quad-core Core processor (as with the version with the Retina Display) and will also be available with Nvidia GeForce GT 650M (Kepler) discrete graphics.
The 15-inch MacBook Pro ha a 1440-by-900 display, with the entry model having a 2.3 GHz quad-core Core i7 processor, GT 650M with 512MB of graphic memory, 4GB of RAM, and a 500GB hard drive for $1,799.
A version with a 2.6 GHz processor, 1GB of graphic memory, 8GB of RAM and a 750GB hard drive ha a list price of $2,199. It is 0.95-inches thick and weighs 5.6 pounds. (Note the Retina display version start at the same price, but ha a smaller yet higher–resolution screen, a 2.3 GHz quad-core processor, and 256GB of flash storage instead of a hard drive.)  When the MacBook Air wa first introduced, it stood out because of how thin and light it was.
Now, the MacBook Pro come close. If, in an era of Ultrabooks , they no longer look so unique, they still are very strong looking machines. Similarly, the new MacBook Pros are now much thinner a well, though not so light; they are mostly aimed at the premium part of the notebook market. Still, for that market, the standout is the new version with the Retina display, which also is lighter and thinner—a better deal if you can live with a 13-inch display.
