XIAOTITLE Google to sell it own, small tablet computer - San Jose Mercury News.
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”Google is unveiling a small tablet computer bearing it brand.
Called the Nexus Seven, the tablet will have a screen that measure 7 inch diagonally, smaller than the nearly 10 inch on Apple Inc. s popular iPad.
That mean it s more likely to challenge Amazon.com Inc. s Kindle Fire, which is also 7 inches.
The Nexus Seven will run the next version of Google Inc. s Android operating system, called Jelly Bean.
The tablet is also designed specifically for Google Play, the company s online store for movies, music, games, book and apps.
Google said Wednesday that Google Play will now offer movie for sale, rather than only rentals.
A Google expansion into the tablet market brings another imposing entrant into what is already a battle of tech heavyweights.
Last week, Microsoft Corp. announced it own tablet, Surface.
Expected to go on sale this fall, Surface will run on a revamped version of Windows and compete directly with the iPad.
Although the tablet carry the Google brand, the machine will be made by AsusTek Computer Inc. Google also recently expanded into the device-making business with it $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility, but the company ha stressed that it intends to continue to rely on Asus and other manufacturer that have embraced Android.
There are already other Android-powered tablet on the market, but none have proven nearly a popular a the iPad or Kindle Fire.
That ha raised worry at Google a more people rely on tablet to surf the Internet.
If Apple and Amazon establish themselves a the dominant tablet makers, they could set up their operating system in way that de-emphasize Google s Internet search engine and other services.
Apple develops it own system, while Amazon modifies Android for use in Kindles.
Apple already ha announced that the next version of the iPad operating system will abandon Google s digital map a the built-in navigation system.
That shift could cause neighborhood merchant to spend le money advertising on Google.
Earlier Wednesday, Google unveiled a new search tool to help you get the right information at the right time on your mobile device.
