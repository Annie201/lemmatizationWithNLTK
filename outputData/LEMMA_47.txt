Sage s Apples is a family fruit and vegetable farm and farm market.
Everything we grow is sold through our local farm market in Chardon.
Our goal is to grow the best tasting and highest quality locally grown produce for our customers.
In order to control this we grow a much of the produce our self a possible including the Apples that come from our 25 acre orchard.
We are located about 25miles East of Cleveland, Ohio.
The majority of our other produce such a Red Raspberries, Blueberries, Peaches, Sweet Corn, Green Beans, Plums, Nectarines, Zucchini, Beets, and Tomatoes are also grown here on our farm.
Some item may be supplemented with locally grown vegetable where needed, but a little a possible.
You can count on all our produce to be locally grown within Geauga County or surrounding county to extend the season.
