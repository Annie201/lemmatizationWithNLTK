Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.
However, the company ha received widespread criticism for it contractor labor, and for it environmental and business practices.
Established on April 1, 1976 in Cupertino , California, and incorporated January 3, 1977, the company wa named Apple Computer, Inc. for it first 30 years.
The word Computer wa removed from it name on January 9, 2007, a it traditional focus on personal computer shifted towards consumer electronics . History
1976–1980: The early year Apple wa established on April 1, 1976 by Steve Jobs , Steve Wozniak , and Ronald Wayne , to sell the Apple I personal computer kit.
They were hand-built by Wozniak and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club . The Apple I wa sold a a motherboard (with CPU , RAM , and basic textual-video chips)—less than what is today considered a complete personal computer.
The Apple I , Apple s first product, wa sold a an assembled circuit board and lacked basic feature such a a keyboard, monitor, and case.
The owner of this unit added a keyboard and a wooden case.
Apple wa incorporated January 3, 1977 without Wayne, who sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800.
Multi-millionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.
The Apple II wa introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first West Coast Computer Faire . It differed from it major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET , because it came with character cell based color graphic and an open architecture . While early model used ordinary cassette tape a storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drive and interface, the Disk II . The Apple II wa chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world—the VisiCalc spreadsheet program.
VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II, and gave home user an additional reason to buy an Apple II—compatibility with the office.
According to Brian Bagnall, Apple exaggerated it sale figure and wa a distant third place to Commodore and Tandy until VisiCalc came along.
By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designer and a production line.
The company introduced the ill-fated Apple III in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with IBM and Microsoft in the business and corporate computing market.
Jobs and several Apple employee including Jef Raskin visited Xerox PARC in December 1979 to see the Xerox Alto . Xerox granted Apple engineer three day of access to the PARC facility in return for the option to buy 100,000 share (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.
Jobs wa immediately convinced that all future computer would use a graphical user interface ( GUI ), and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa . In 1980, Apple went public, generating more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956 and instantly creating more millionaire (about 300) than any company in history.
Steve Jobs began working on the Apple Lisa in 1978 but in 1982 he wa pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin s low-cost-computer project, the Macintosh . A turf war broke out between Lisa s corporate shirt and Jobs pirate over which product would ship first and save Apple.
Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but wa a commercial failure due to it high price tag and limited software titles.
In 1984, Apple next launched the Macintosh.
Its debut wa announced by the now famous $1.5 million television commercial 1984 . It wa directed by Ridley Scott , aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, and is now considered a watershed event for Apple s success and a masterpiece .
The Macintosh initially sold well, but follow-up sale were not strong due to it high price and limited range of software titles.
The machine s fortune changed with the introduction of the LaserWriter , the first PostScript laser printer to be offered at a reasonable price, and PageMaker , an early desktop publishing package.
The Mac wa particularly powerful in this market due to it advanced graphic capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.
It ha been suggested that the combination of these three product wa responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.
In 1985 a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO John Sculley , who had been hired two year earlier.
The Apple board of director instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive foray into untested products.
Rather than submit to Sculley s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.
Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a putsch and called a board meeting at which Apple s board of director sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.
Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.
Having learned several painful lesson after introducing the bulky Macintosh Portable in 1989, Apple introduced the PowerBook in 1991.
The Macintosh Portable wa designed to be just a powerful a a desktop Macintosh, but weighed 7.5 kilogram (17 lb) with a 12-hour battery life.
The same year, Apple introduced System 7 , a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities.
It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001.
The success of the PowerBook and other product brought increasing revenue.
For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new product and generating increasing profit in the process.
The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 a the first golden age of the Macintosh.
Following the success of the Macintosh LC , Apple introduced the Centris line, a low-end Quadra offering, and the ill-fated Performa line that wa sold in several confusing configuration and software bundle to avoid competing with the various consumer outlet such a Sears , Price Club , and Wal-Mart , who were the primary dealer for these models.
The result wa disastrous for Apple a consumer did not understand the difference between models.
During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted product including digital camera , portable CD audio player , speaker , video console , and TV appliance . Enormous resource were also invested in the problem-plagued Newton division based on John Sculley s unrealistic market forecasts.
Ultimately, all this proved too-little-too-late, a Apple s market share and stock price continued to slide.
Apple saw the Apple II series a too expensive to produce, while taking away sale from the low end Macintosh.
In 1990, Apple released the Macintosh LC with a single expansion slot for the Apple IIe Card to migrate Apple II user to the Macintosh platform.
Apple stopped selling the Apple IIe in 1993.
Microsoft continued to gain market share with Windows , focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computer while Apple wa delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.
Apple relied on high profit margin and never developed a clear response.
Instead they sued Microsoft for using a graphical user interface similar to the Apple Lisa in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation . The lawsuit dragged on for year before it wa finally dismissed.
At the same time, a series of major product flop and missed deadline sullied Apple s reputation, and Sculley wa replaced by Michael Spindler . 1994–1997: Attempts at reinvention

Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called eWorld , developed in collaboration with America Online and designed a a Mac-friendly alternative to other online service such a CompuServe . The Macintosh platform wa itself becoming outdated because it wa not built for multitasking, and several important software routine were programmed directly into the hardware.
In addition, Apple wa facing competition from OS/2 and UNIX vendor like Sun Microsystems . The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.
In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and Motorola in the AIM alliance . The goal wa to create a new computing platform (the PowerPC Reference Platform ), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple s software.
The AIM alliance hoped that PReP s performance and Apple s software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft.
The same year, Apple introduced the Power Macintosh , the first of many Apple computer to use IBM s PowerPC processor.
In 1996, Michael Spindler wa replaced by Gil Amelio a CEO.
Gil Amelio made many change at Apple, including extensive layoffs.

Apple retail store allow potential customer to use floor model without making a purchase.
Mac OS X , based on NeXT s OPENSTEP and BSD Unix wa released on March 24, 2001, after several year of development.
Aimed at consumer and professional alike, Mac OS X aimed to combine the stability, reliability and security of Unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface.
To aid user in migrating from Mac OS 9 , the new operating system allowed the use of OS 9 application through Mac OS X s Classic environment . On May 19, 2001, Apple opened the first official Apple Retail Stores in Virginia and California.

iCloud is the fourth generation of online service provided by Apple, and wa preceded by MobileMe , .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degree of success.
Apple aficionado wait in line around an Apple retail store in anticipation of a new product.
This branch is located on Fifth Avenue in New York City, with a glass cube housing a cylindrical elevator and a spiral staircase that lead into the subterranean store.
The scene I witnessed at the opening of the new Apple store in London s Covent Garden were more like an evangelical prayer meeting than a chance to buy a phone or a laptop.
– Alex Riley , writing for the BBC Apple brand and brand community . Apple s brand s loyalty is considered unusual for any product.
At one time, Apple evangelist were actively engaged by the company, but this wa after the phenomenon wa already firmly established.
Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki ha called the brand fanaticism something that wa stumbled upon .
Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of Mac User Groups in most major and many minor center of population where Mac computer are available.
Mac user would meet at the European Apple Expo and the San Francisco Macworld Conference Expo trade show where Apple traditionally introduced new product each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events.
While the conference continue, Apple doe not have official representation there.
Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference . Apple Store opening can draw crowd of thousands, with some waiting in line a much a a day before the opening or flying in from other country for the event.
The New York City Fifth Avenue Cube store had a line a long a half a mile; a few Mac fan took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.
The Ginza opening in Tokyo wa estimated in the thousand with a line exceeding eight city blocks.
John Sculley told The Guardian newspaper in 1997: People talk about technology, but Apple wa a marketing company.
Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer wa usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers.
The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. product are more expensive than other PC products.
Name According to Steve Jobs, Apple wa so named because Jobs wa coming back from an apple farm, and he wa on a fruitarian diet.
He thought the name wa fun, spirited and not intimidating .
Apple s first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree.
Almost immediately, though, this wa replaced by Rob Janoff s rainbow Apple , the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it.
Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic theme for the bitten logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it.
While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.
The Apple logo wa designed with a bite so that it would not be recognized a another fruit.
The colored stripe were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphic in color.
This logo is often erroneously referred to a a tribute to Alan Turing , with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.
Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.
In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to it previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising.
An Aqua -themed version of the monochrome logo wa used from 2001–2003, and a Glass-themed version ha been used since 2003.
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were Beatles fans, but Apple Inc. had trademark issue with Apple Corps Ltd. , a multimedia company started by The Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo.
This resulted in a series of lawsuit and tension between the two companies.
These issue ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.
Apple s first slogan, Byte into an Apple , wa coined in the late 1970s.
From 1997–2002, Apple used the slogan Think Different in advertising campaigns.
Although the slogan ha been retired, it is still closely associated with Apple.
Apple also ha slogan for specific product lines — for example, iThink, therefore iMac wa used in 1998 to promote the iMac, and Say hello to iPhone ha been used in iPhone advertisements.
Hello wa also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton , iMac ( hello (again) ), and iPod.
Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial to the more modern Get a Mac adverts, Apple ha been recognized in the past for it effort towards effective advertising and marketing for it products, though it advertising ha been criticized for the claim of some more recent campaigns, particularly 2005 Power Mac ad and iPhone ad in Britain.
Apple s product commercial gained fame for launching musician into stardom a a result of their eye-popping graphic and catchy tunes.
First, the company popularized Canadian singer Feist s 1234 song in it ad campaign.
Later, Apple used the song New Soul by French-Israeli singer-songwriter Yael Naïm to promote the MacBook Air . The debut single shot to the top of the chart and sold hundred of thousand of copy in a span of weeks.
During the Mac s early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standard for hardware, instead creating their own.
This trend wa largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple s adoption of the PCI bus in the 7500 / 8500 / 9500 Power Macs . Apple ha since adopted USB , AGP , HyperTransport , Wi-Fi , and other industry standard in it computer and wa in some case a leader in the adoption of standard such a USB.
FireWire is an Apple-originated standard that ha seen widespread industry adoption after it wa standardized a IEEE 1394 . Ever since the first Apple Store opened, Apple ha sold third party accessories.
For instance, at one point Nikon and Canon digital camera were sold inside the store.
Adobe , one of Apple s oldest software partners, also sell it Mac-compatible software, a doe Microsoft, who sell Microsoft Office for the Mac.
Books from John Wiley Sons , who publishes the For Dummies series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however.
The publisher s line of book were banned from Apple Stores in 2005 because Steve Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography, iCon . After the launch of the iBookstore , Apple stopped selling physical books, both online and at the Apple Retail Stores.
Apple Inc. s world corporate headquarters are located in the middle of Silicon Valley , at 1–6 Infinite Loop , Cupertino , California.
This Apple campus ha six building that total 850,000 square foot (79,000 m 2 ) and wa built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.
Apple created subsidiary in low-tax place such a Ireland , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands to cut the tax it pay around the world.
According to the New York Times, Apple wa among the first tech company to designate overseas salesperson in high-tax country in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiary on other continents, sidestepping income taxes.
Apple wa a pioneer of an accounting technique known a the Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich, which reduces tax by routing profit through Irish subsidiary and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.
In 2006, Apple announced it intention to build a second campus on 50 acre (200,000 m 2 ) assembled from various contiguous plot (east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway).
Later acquisition increased this to 175 acres.
The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus.
The new campus building will be designed by Norman Foster . On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and it environs.
The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employee in one central four-storied circular building (with a café for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure).
There will be additional building such a an auditorium, R D facilities, a fitness center and a dedicated generating plant a primary source of electricity (powered by natural gas and other more environmentally sound means).
Headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa Apple s headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland . The facility, which opened in 1980, wa Apple s first location outside of the United States.
Apple Sales International, which deal with all of Apple s international sale outside of the USA, is located at Apple s campus in Cork along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deal with Apple s international distribution network.
On April 20, 2012, Apple announced the addition of 500 new job to it European headquarters.
This will bring the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees.
The company will build a new office block on it Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff.
Corporate culture Apple wa one of several highly successful company founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notion of what a corporate culture should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.).
Other highly successful firm with similar cultural aspect from the same period include Southwest Airlines and Microsoft . Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitor like IBM by default, thanks to the influence of it founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple wa a Fortune 500 company.
By the time of the 1984 TV ad , this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from it competitors.
As the company ha grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of it original character ha arguably been lost, but Apple still ha a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draw talented people into it employ, especially after Jobs return.
To recognize the best of it employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individual who made extraordinary technical or leadership contribution to personal computing while at the company.
The Apple Fellowship ha so far been awarded to a few individual including Bill Atkinson , Steve Capps , Rod Holt, Alan Kay , Guy Kawasaki , Al Alcorn , Don Norman , Rich Page , and Steve Wozniak . Numerous employee of Apple have cited that project without Jobs involvement often take longer than project with his involvement.
Another present the image of Jobs wandering the hall with a flame thrower in hand, asking random people do you work on MobileMe ? .
At Apple, employee are specialist who are not exposed to function outside their area of expertise.
Jobs saw this a a mean of having best-in-class employee in every role.
For instance, Ron Johnson who wa Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, wa responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control of the inventory in his store (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO Tim Cook who ha a background in supply-chain management).
This is the opposite of General Electric s corporate culture which ha created well-rounded managers.
Under the leadership of Tim Cook who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position a CEO, Apple ha developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which ha been ranked a the world s best for the four year 2007–2010 . The company s manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launch without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple s profit margin have been 40 percent compared with 10–20 percent for most other hardware company in 2011.
Cook s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company s operational edge is “Nobody want to buy sour milk”.
The company previously advertised it product a being made in America up to the late 1990s, however a a result of outsourcing initiative in the 2000s almost all of it manufacturing is now done abroad.
According to a report by the New York Times , Apple insider believe the vast scale of overseas factory a well a the flexibility, diligence and industrial skill of foreign worker have so outpaced their American counterpart that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple product .
Finance In it fiscal year ending in September 2011, Apple Inc. hit new height financially with $108 billion in revenue (increased significantly from $65 billion in 2010) and nearly $82 billion in cash reserves.
Apple achieved these result while losing market share in certain product categories.
On March 19, 2012, Apple announced plan for a $2.65 per share dividend beginning in fourth quarter of 2012, per approval by their board of directors.
Environmental record Greenpeace ha campaigned against Apple on various environmental issues, including a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware component and toxin within iPhone hardware.
Since 2003 Greenpeace ha campaigned against Apple s use of particular chemical in it products, more specifically, the inclusion of PVC and BFRs in their products.
On May 2, 2007, Steve Jobs released a report announcing plan to eliminate PVC and BFRs by the end of 2008.
Apple ha since eliminated PVC and BFRs across it product range, becoming the first laptop maker to do so.
In the first edition, released in August 2006, Apple scored 2.7/10.
The Environmental Protection Agency rate Apple highest amongst producer of notebook computers, and fairly well compared to producer of desktop computer and LCD display . In June 2007, Apple upgraded the MacBook Pro , replacing cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD display with mercury -free LED backlit LCD display and arsenic -free glass, and ha since done this for all notebooks.
Apple ha also phased out BFRs and PVCs from various internal components.
Apple offer information about the emissions, materials, and electrical usage of each product.
In June 2009, Apple s iPhone 3GS wa free of PVC, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.
In October 2009, Apple upgraded the iMac and MacBook, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD display with mercury-free LED backlit LCD display and arsenic-free glass.
This mean all Apple computer have mercury free LED backlit displays, arsenic-free glass and are without PVC cables.
All Apple computer also have EPEAT Gold status.
In 2010, Climate Counts , a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumer toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 point out of a possible 100, which put Apple in their top category Striding .
This wa an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 point out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a stuck icon , adding that Apple at the time wa a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer .
In October 2011 Chinese authority have ordered an Apple supplier to close part of it plant in Suzhou after resident living nearby raised significant environmental concerns.
In November 2011 Apple featured in Greenpeace s Guide to Greener Electronics that rank electronics manufacturer on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their product are.
The company ranked 4th out of 15 electronics company (moving up five place from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.
Greenpeace praise Apple s sustainability, noting that the company exceeded it 70% global recycling goal in 2010.
It continues to score well on the product rating with all Apple product now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants.
However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criterion for not seeking external verification of it greenhouse gas emission data and for not setting out any target to reduce emissions.
In January 2012, Apple announced plan and requested that their cable maker Volex begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.
In 2006, the Mail on Sunday reported on working condition existed at factory in China where the contract manufacturer Foxconn and Inventec produced the iPod.
The article stated that one complex of factory that assembles the iPod (among other items) had over 200,000 worker that lived and worked in the factory, with employee regularly working more than 60 hour per week.
The article also reported that worker made around $100 per month and were required to live pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of worker earnings.
Apple immediately launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturer to ensure acceptable working conditions.
In 2007, Apple started yearly audit of all it supplier regarding worker s right , slowly raising standard and pruning supplier that did not comply.
Yearly progress report have been published since 2008.
In 2010, worker in China planned to sue iPhone contractor over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens.
One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.
After a spate of suicide in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit at a lower rate than in China a a whole, worker were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.
In 2011 Apple admitted that it supplier child labor practice in China had worsened.
Workers in factory producing Apple product have also been exposed to n- Hexane , a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.
