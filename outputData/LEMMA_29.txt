XIAOTITLE Apple almost 25 percent of computer market, if iPads are counted (or not... see update) | The Verge.
Despite the profusion of Android tablet we saw at CES, Chris Whitmore from Deutsche Bank doesn t think Apple ha anything to worry about in term of iPad competition.
To emphasize the importance of the iPad to computing, Whitmore created the chart above, which take market share report for the computer market, then add iPads in the last line.
Given that Android device made up about 30 percent of the tablet market in Q3 of 2011, adding tablet in general would make the chart look somewhat different, but there s no denying that it s quite dramatic.
Update: Things may not be a they seem!
Over at Apple Outsider , they ve run the number and gotten closer to 15 percent Apple market share with iPads added in; they speculate that Whitmore may have re-added all Apple computers, not just iPads.
Here s some updated data , including source and method â€” their version of the chart is below.
Checking the calculations, we re seeing roughly the same thing.
