XIAOTITLE Apple - The latest on Apple - CNET News.
Editor s note: The iPhone is 5 year old.
Last year, I reflected on my very first iPhone, and what owning one wa like before the smartphone landscape had utterly changed...before the App Store...before iPads.
What I wrote last year is still true now, maybe even more so, although one important event ha transpired since: Steve Jobs died October 5, 2011, le than four month later.
What follows is what I wrote, along with photo of that iPhone that I still have kicking around, compared with the iPhone 4S.
Looking at them side by side, it s amazing how little ha changed in term of form.
It wa only 2007 when the iPhone debuted.
It seems like longer.
My first HDTV, my Wii, and my PlayStation 3 all existed before the first iPhone.
Yet, in 2007, BlackBerrys were all the rage.
The Motorola Q wa an eye-catching phone.
Android didn t exist.
Also, my grandparent were still alive.
I wasn t married.
I didn t have a kid.
I wa freelance-writing a novel.
My life wa different then.
The iPhone line were crazy, but if you picked the right time you could sneak into an Apple Store and buy one.
That s because the first iPhone started at $499.
No one knew yet whether the device wa a smash hit.
Apple didn t have a reservation system in place yet, or claim tickets.
In the summer of 2007, the iPhone wa a novelty.
