XIAOTITLE Rare Apple 1 computer sold for £240k - Telegraph.
The computer, consisting only of a naked motherboard, with primitive microchip and circuitry exposed, is thought to be one of only around half a dozen working example of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak s first hardware.
Some 200 Apple 1 were built in 1976 and sold at retail for $666.66 without a case, keboard, monitor or power supply.
The computer had 4 kilobyte of memory a standard and a processor running at 1 MHz.
By comparison, the latest iPhone ha 512 megabyte of memory, and a dual-core processor running at 800 MHz.
The Apple 1 sold for $374,500 (£240,929) at an auction in New York.
The price wa considerably more than Sotheby s estimate of $180,000 and set a new record for a sale of one of the machines.
When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs presented the Apple 1 Computer to the Homebrew Computer Club in 1976, it wa dismissed by everyone but Paul Terrell, the owner of a chain of store called Byte Shop, said Sotheby s in it catalogue for the auction, which is scheduled to take place in New York today.
The Apple 1 wa different to most personal computer at the time.
Steve Wozniak told peer in the Homebrew Computer Club that his circuitry and software enabled a human-typable keyboard instead of a stupid, cryptic front panel with a bunch of light and switch .
It s estimated that of the original 200, only around 50 remain, and only six of those are known to be in working order.
Two year ago Christies sold a working Apple 1 for $210,700, although it came with a signed letter from Steve Jobs.
Earlier this year a prototype of the first Apple Mac went on sale on eBay, with a starting price of $99,995 but no bid were made.
