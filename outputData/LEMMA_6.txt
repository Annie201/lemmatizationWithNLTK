NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Think the iPad s price tag is steep?
One famed Apple product, the original Apple I, sold for $374,500 on Friday.
Auction house Sotheby s sold a 1976 Apple I Computer -- which still works!
-- in New York on Friday, after a bidding war broke out between two potential buyers.
The lucky winner?
An anonymous telephone bidder.
For $374,500, the buyer could have bought 750 entry-level iPads, more than 1,880 iPhones (with a two-year contract, of course) or around 650 share of Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ).
Sotheby s touted the device s backstory in an email to press.
Apple founder Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the Apple I Computer in 1976 and attracted the attention of Silicon Valley store chain Byte Shop.
Store owner Paul Terrell ordered 50 of the computer for $500 each, which the late Jobs and Wozniak put together in just 30 days.
Terrell sold them for $666.66 each, and the Apple duo made 150 more to sell to friend and other stores.
The Apple I wa a marvel for it time, but it wa quite different than today s computers, Sotheby s noted: The Apple I lacked a monitor, keyboard, power supply and case.
