XIAOTITLE Home Fruit Production - Apples.
Adapted from the publication Home Garden Fruit Production - Apples by Rob Crasweller, Cooperative Extension Service, The Pennsylvania State University.
Apples are a popular home-grown fruit that can be produced successfully in most area of the state.
The key to producing quality fruit in a home orchard are proper and timely care of the tree and variety selection.
If you are unwilling to maintain the tree and fruit, then you should not plant them.
This publication offer the amateur fruit grower some advice on the proper selection and care of apple trees.
Plentiful sunlight is a key to maximizing fruit production.
Choose an area in your landscape that is in the sun most or all of the day.
Otherwise, expect reduced performance from the trees.
Early morning sun is particularly important to dry dew from the plants, thereby reducing the incidence of diseases.
Good drainage is a more important consideration than soil fertility.
Avoid soil and site that are not well drained.
Poor drainage would be expected in an area where water stand for more than 24 hour after a rain.
In these areas, root will not receive enough oxygen and will die, resulting in stunted growth and eventual death of the tree.
If such condition exist, planting on a raised terrace will help.
In area with alkaline soils, cotton root rot is a severe problem for which there is no control at this time.
If your landscape ha a history of losing plant to this organism, avoid planting apple because they are very sensitive to it.
The old adage you get what you pay for is an important consideration when buying apple trees.
Bargain plant may not be healthy or may be a variety not adapted to your area.
Buy only tree of recommended variety from a reliable source.
Remember the following point when purchasing apple trees.
A healthy 1-year-old whip, approximately 2 to 3 foot tall with a 1/2-inch diameter trunk and a good root system, is preferred.
A small tree with a good root system is more desirable than a large tree with a poor root system.
Trees that are 2 year old or older are often not a good a 1-year-old trees.
Older tree frequently lack sufficient bud on the lower portion of the trunk to develop a good framework.
If older tree are purchased, cut them back to force out bud lower on the main trunk.
Do not purchase tree that appear stunted, poorly grown, diseased or insect injured.
Closely check label to make sure the selection is the desired variety and rootstock; it is critical that the rootstock be specified, otherwise one may get a seedling rootstock which is very slow to bear.
Do not purchase dried, shriveled plant even at discount prices.
Many of the 6,000 named apple variety have given way to superior tasting varieties.
Some apple variety such Red Delicious and Golden Delicious are also available in various strains.
A strain is a mutation of a variety that ha been selected and propagated for an improved characteristic.
Strains may differ in fruit or growth characteristic or both.
Some variety have many strains; for example, approximately 250 different strain of Red Delicious have been described and cultivated.
Strains may be spur-type or nonspur-type.
Spur-type strain are ideally suited for home gardener with space limitation because fruit spur and leaf bud are more closely spaced than on nonspur strains.
Spur strain of a variety generally grow only about 60 to 70 percent a large a the nonspur strain of that variety.
Many apple variety can be grown in Texas.
Top variety are listed in order of ripening season.
Refer to the Texas map for area of adaptation for each variety.
Note that most variety that ripen in June and July will not maintain good fruit quality for longer than 2 to 3 week even in cold storage.
Plant late maturing variety if you want fruit that will keep well into the winter.
Dorsett Golden - yellow, low chill apple for South Texas only.
Pollinator for Anna.
Anna - medium-size low chill apple for South Texas only.
Has a slight red blush, crisp, good-flavored fruit.
Noted for heavy production.
Plant with Dorsett Golden for pollination.
Jersey Mac - Red McIntosh type apple with crisp texture and tart flavor.
Adina - large fruit, sweet with distinctive taste.
Gala - orange-red, flavor is like a spicy Golden Delicious.
A top quality eating apple.
Stark Royal Gala - like Stark Gala except brighter red.
Mollies Delicious - red, excellent dessert quality, not Delicious-type although very similar in appearance and flavor.
Ozark Gold - yellow, Delicious-type dessert apple.
Starkrimson Red Delicious - red, excellent quality, Delicious-type, widely planted in this area.
Braeburn - red, highly flavored with an even sugar to acid balance.
A heavy cropper that will usually need thinning to maintain yearly cropping.
Fuji - red, sweet flavor, good crisp texture.
Granny Smith - green, excellent quality for dessert or cooking.
Pink Lady - pinkish color with excellent quality for fresh or processing use.
The two dominating influence on tree size are the rootstock and the type of strain used (spur or nonspur).
Other factor that influence ultimate tree size include general care, variety, soil type, earliness of fruiting and time and severity of pruning.
Apple tree size a influenced by rootstock is generally divided into three categories: standard, semidwarf and dwarf.
Standard tree are propagated on seedling rootstock and produce large tree that may grow 30 foot tall.
Semidwarf tree are propagated on one of the clonal (vegetatively propagated) rootstock that produce tree about three-fourths the size of standard tree if both are grown under similar circumstances.
The most common semidwarf rootstock used for apple are M 7 or M 7a, MM 106 and MM 111.
Trees on M 7 produce the smallest tree while tree on MM 106 produce the earliest bearing trees.
The MM 106 and MM 111 rootstock produce the larger semidwarf trees.
The interstem tree, a different type of semidwarf rootstock, may be available from certain nurseries.
They have a small section of M 9 grafted between an understock, such a MM 111 or MM 106, and the variety.
These tree are slightly larger than dwarf tree but smaller than the semidwarf.
Because of the extra propagation needed, interstem tree are the most expensive.
Plant these tree with the bottom of the interstem just above the soil line.
Trees on semidwarf and dwarf rootstock are ideally suited for home fruit production.
Although more expensive to purchase, smaller tree are easier to prune, spray and harvest and they produce fruit at an earlier age than do full-sized trees.
Dwarf tree will be about 30 to 40 percent a large a standard tree and require support by either a trellis or a post.
The most common dwarf rootstock is M 9.
Apple variety require pollen from another variety to set fruit; therefore, plant two or more variety with overlapping bloom periods.
Some variety bear heavy crop when pollinated by another pollen-producing variety but do not produce good pollen themselves.
Plant at least two of the variety which are recommended for your area of the state.
When fruit tree arrive from the nursery, open the bundle immediately and inspect for damage and general condition of the trees.
Soak the root in water 1/2 to 1 hour before planting.
Plant tree while still dormant in the early spring if the soil is not too wet.
Thoroughly prepare the soil with deep cultivation, either by hand or with a rototiller before planting.
If this is not possible, pull out the grass and weed in a 3 foot circle around the tree once they green up in the spring.
Glyphosate herbicide is an excellent product to use.
One must not allow the product to contact the foliage on the tree.
In planting, dig hole large enough to receive the root freely without cramping or bending from their natural position.
Cut off all broken or mutilated part of root with pruning shears.
Set the plant with the graft or bud union no more than 1 inch above the soil line (Figure 1).
Work soil in and around the roots.
When the hole is half filled, firm the soil with your feet.
Finish filling the hole and again pack the soil firmly.
Do not leave a large depression around the tree.
Also, do not place fertilizer in the planting hole or fertilize immediately after planting.
After planting, apply sufficient water to thoroughly soak the soil in the area of the tree roots.
This watering brings the soil into closer contact with all side of the root and eliminates air pocket around the roots.
The day you plant your tree is the day you begin to prune and train for future production.
Neglect result in poor growth and delayed fruiting.
Pruning a young tree control it shape by developing a strong, well-balanced framework of scaffold branches.
Remove or cut back unwanted branch early to avoid the necessity of large cut in later years.
The currently preferred method of pruning and training nontrellised tree is the central leader system.
Pruning in late winter consists of removing undesirable limb a well a tipping terminal to encourage branching.
Summer training is most beneficial if done in early June.
Figure 2A show the height to which the tree should be cut back at planting.
Heading back the tree to this height brings the top and the root back into balance and cause bud just below the cut to grow and form scaffold branch (Figure 2B).
Begin training the tree when 2 to 3 inch of growth are evident.
Position wooden spring-type clothespin between the main trunk or branch and the new succulent growth (Figure 2C).
The clothespin force the new growth outward and upward and form the strong crotch angle needed to support the fruit load in year to come.
Allow the most vigorous upright branch to continue growing straight up and become the central leader.
A number of branch will develop during the first growing season.
If they are clothespinned they will form good crotch angles.
The objective now is to develop a strong central leader and framework of scaffold branches.
Figure 3 illustrates what the tree might look like before and after pruning done in the winter following planting.
The objective is to leave only four or five main scaffold branches, spaced around the tree.
When viewed from above, the tree should present a branch arrangement similar to that shown in the insert in Figure 3.
Always prune the end of the scaffold branch so they are below the end of the central leader and head the central leader back by one-fourth to one-half in length each year.
Special note: Occasionally a tree doe not grow a well a it should during the first year.
In this case, prune the tree back to a whip and start over again.
Fruiting will be delayed a year, but it will be a much more manageable tree.
During the second growing season, develop a second layer of scaffold 24 to 36 inch above those established the year before.
Be sure to clothespin the second level to develop wide crotch angles.
Figure 4 illustrates a properly trained apple tree late in the season.
The use of limb spreader encourages earlier fruit production, better tree shape, stronger crotch angle and better fruit color.
Spreaders can be short piece of wood with sharpened nail driven into each end or sharpened metal rods.
Do not spread limb below a 60 degree angle from the main trunk.
When spread wider, limb produce vigorous sucker along the topside of the branch.
Leave spreader in place for 1 to 2 year while the branch stiffens.
Figure 4 illustrates a 2-year-old tree before and after pruning; the arrow indicate spreaders.
Always spread the tree before pruning.
The pruning consists of entirely removing undesirable upright limb and reducing the length of new shoot growth by one-fourth.
Continue to head back new terminal growth by one-fourth each year and remove other upright limbs.
Remove broken or diseased limbs.
Always maintain the central leader a the highest point on the tree and keep the end of the primary and secondary scaffold below the top of the tree.
Prune the tree every year in late winter (February or March).
Apple tree are generally fertilized with nitrogen each year.
In fact that is the only fertilizer most apple tree will need, especially if the soil pH is above 7.8.
If your soil pH is between 6 and 7.5, or if your soil test indicates you need P or K, your first fertilizer application can be a 3-1-2 ratio fertilizer such a 15-5-10, otherwise just use nitrogen; usually ammonium sulfate.
One month after planting, broadcast 1 cup of 21-0-0 over a 2-foot circle around the tree if the tree ha made 6 inch of growth.
Keep the fertilizer 6 inch away from the trunk and broadcast it evenly over the recommended area.
In May and June following planting, broadcast another cup of 21-0-0 around the tree.
In early spring of the second season, broadcast 1 cup of 21-0-0 fertilizer over a 3-foot circle; again avoid contact with the tree.
Repeat this again in April, May, and June.
In year three, use 2 cup four time and in year four, 3 cup four times.
After 4 years, fertilize the tree a if they were mature.
Once tree begin to bear fruit, use the length of shoot growth a an indication of whether previously recommended fertilization rate need to be decreased or increased.
Growth of 12 to 18 inch per year is ideal for bearing trees.
Typically we will use one pound of 21-0-0 per inch of trunk diameter.
Hence if the trunk diameter of the tree is 8 inch 3 1/2 foot off the ground, we would apply 4 lb of 21-0-0 at budbreak and the other 4 lb in May. However, we only apply the 4 lb in May if we set a good crop.
If the crop set is poor or nonexistent, leave off the second application.
In most section of Texas, supplemental water is required for healthy tree growth.
Water young tree weekly.
Mature tree normally receive adequate moisture in a landscape setting if the lawn or garden area is irrigated.
As a general rule of thumb, most fruit plant would like one inch of water per week.
This can be applied weekly, but never go longer than 3 week without water.
Eliminating weed competition around young tree is critical for tree survival and rapid growth.
Ideally, keep the soil surface weed-free in an area at least a wide a the limb spread of the tree.
The safest way to do this is with a hoe.
However, there are chemical that do a good job of weed control.
However, before using such herbicide all aspect of safety and sprayer calibration should be well understood.
Apple tree grown under favorable condition will set more fruit than they are capable of successfully carrying to maturity.
Removing excess fruit from the tree ensures satisfactory development of color, shape and size of the apple that remain on the tree.
Failure to remove excess fruit decrease formation of flower bud for the following year and cause tree to produce a crop only every other year.
The earlier hand thinning is completed, the more effective it will be in achieving the desired results.
Midsummer thinning help improve fruit size and aid formation of next year s flower buds.
Most of the flower bud for next year are initiated during a 4-to 6-week period following full bloom.
Therefore, thinning should be done before this time.
Remove fruit by hand.
Leave one apple per cluster, and space the cluster about every 6 inches.
Start at one end of a branch and systematically remove fruit.
To remove the fruit without damaging the spur or other apple on the spur, hold the stem between the thumb and forefinger and push the fruit from the stem with the other fingers.
This method remove the apple and leaf the stem attached to the spur.
Caution: The insecticide carbaryl or Sevin(TM) can cause thinning if applied shortly after petal fall.
Avoid using it during this period.
If using a general purpose, home orchard mix, check the label for ingredients.
Harvest time varies with individual taste and locality.
One may consider a fruit ripe while another individual belief it is immature.
However, fruit picked too soon doe not store well and doe not develop full flavor.
When picking apples, it is important to avoid injury to the fruit.
Remove the apple from the spur by pulling upward and outward while rotating the fruit slightly.
On some of the thin, long-stemmed variety such a Golden Delicious, it is sometimes necessary to firmly place the index finger at the point of attachment on the stem and spur to prevent the spur from breaking.
Apples picked with the stem attached to the fruit keep longer.
The best quality fruit is produced when disease and insect are controlled.
Common apple disease that should be controlled include scab, cedar apple rust, fireblight, sooty blotch and bitter rot.
Damaging insect are spider mites, plum curculio, aphid and coddling moth.
To control fruit tree pests, use one of the home orchard fruit spray mix that are sold by several companies.
Be sure to read and follow all label instruction when applying these or any other pesticide.
