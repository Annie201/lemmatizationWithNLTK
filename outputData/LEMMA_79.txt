XIAOTITLE uglyblackjohn: Apple Bottom Jeans.
If I hear another big girl telling me that she think she look good in her Skinny Jeans ,  I m never going out again.
The thing that kill me is that Nelly named his brand Apple Bottom .
Having an apple bottom is not a good thing...
 Just ask Sherri Shepherd.
Her waist is larger than her butt.
Her butt look like an apple.
 See what I mean?
Not a good shape for a woman.
 To the other extreme is Paris Hilton s Pancake Bottom .
 Who like pancake with no butt(er)?
 But most woman hate to hear that their butt look like a fresh juicy pear.
But a small waist and then....
I thought it wa a good thing.
